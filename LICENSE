"Don't Disrespect The Code". Hopefully this is self-explanitory enough, but for a list of what
would be "disrespectful" refer the text below:

-Code doesn't like mutated half-brothers that go by a different name. This is also known as
changing the name of Code and claiming it's yours.
-Code doesn't like people who use and abuse him without any kind of thanks. You'd be amazed at
how many people use parts of Code without giving even a tiny bit of credit. Code just doesn't 
find that amusing.
-Code is not out to make money, so don't exploit him.
-Code does however like people using him for increasing their knowledge and assists people with
creating newer and better programs.
