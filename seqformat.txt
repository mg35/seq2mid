First 6 bytes are used only when declared as a Sequence bank. Everything is in Big Endian.

0x01-0x02: Number of Songs in Sequence Bank
0x03-0x05: Pointer to first song
0xyy-0xzz: Pointer to second song, third song, etc. etc.

0x06-0x07: Resolution. Same format and byte order as midi's.
0x08-0x09: Number of Tempo events.
0x0A-0x0B: Offset to first non-tempo event. 
0x0C-0x0D: Offset to first tempo event in loop(according to SndSim)

[Tempo Track Start]
      First Tempo Track Entry
0x0E: Step(Delta) Time
0x0F: BPM
   
      Second Tempo Track Entry
0x0F: Step(Delta) Time
0x10: BPM

      etc.

[Normal Track Start]
0x?? - see 0x0A-0x0B

Normal Track Event List and Restrictions
------------------------------------------
Here's a short list of events used by the format. Step(Delta) information is stored at the end
of an event, not before it like midi.

0xFF 0x?? 0x?? 0x?? 0x?? 
Meta Event. Supposedly used, but SndSim itself strips them.

0xBw 0xxx 0xyy 0xzz 
Control Change Event. w is the channel, xx is Control Change number, yy is the value(if 
necessary), and zz is the step time. Control Change 32(for each change) must be at the top of 
the normal track and before the Program Change Event. 

0xCx 0xyy 0xzz
Program Change Event. x is the channel, yy is the program, zz is the step time.

0x00-0x7F 0xww 0xxx 0xyy 0xzz - Note On Event. This event takes a wee bit of explaining. The
high nibble of the first byte is used as the ninth bit for gate and step time, plus one more
unknown item. In the high nibble, the 2nd bit is the 9th bit for step time and 3rd bit is the 
9th bit for gate time. The first bit is unknown. The low nibble is the actual channel. ww is the
key number(same format as midi), xx is the volume, yy is the 1st-8th bit of gate time, and zz is
the 1st-8th bit of step time. 

"What is Gate time?" - It's a replacement for note off in a sense. It's basically a step(delta)
count till a note off is issued. So it cuts down on file size.

0x81 0xyyyy 0xzz
Reference Event. This is how this format is able to really pack the data. Reference basically
goes to an offset starting at the beginning of the normal track and offsets it by yyyy. It
reuses zz events from that offset and jumps back to the old offset afterwards. 

SPECIAL NOTE: You DO NOT count Gate and Step(Delta) Extend Events(although you still handle them). Ironically, 
this was one of the only things correct in the original Sega document ;) 

0x82 0xzz
Loop Event. There will always be two calls of these. One at the start of the loop, and one
at the end. zz is the step time. 

0x83
End of track event. This will always be at the end of the normal track. 

0x88
Gate Extend 0x200 Event. Add 0x200 onto the next Note On gate time value.

0x89
Gate Extend 0x800 Event. Add 0x800 onto the next Note On gate time value.

0x8A
Gate Extend 0x1000 Event. Add 0x1000 onto the next Note On gate time value.

0x8B
Gate Extend 0x2000 Event. Add 0x2000 onto the next Note On gate time value.

0x8C
Step(Delta) Extend 0x100 Event. Add 0x100 onto the next Note On step time value.

0x8D
Step(Delta) Extend 0x200 Event. Add 0x200 onto the next Note On step time value.

0x8E
Step(Delta) Extend 0x800 Event. Add 0x800 onto the next Note On step time value.

0x8F
Step(Delta) Extend 0x1000 Event. Add 0x1000 onto the next Note On step time value.

0xAw 0xxx 0xyy 0xzz
Polyphonic Pressure event(Aftertouch). w is the channel, xx is the key, yy the value, and zz the step time.

0xDx 0xyy 0xzz
Channel Pressure(Aftertouch). x is the channel, yy is the value, and zz is the step time.

0xEx 0xyy 0xzz
Pitch Bend Event. Low nibble of first byte is the channel, yy is the pitch value. To convert to
midi's pitch wheel, just put the value in the second pitch byte(not the first). zz is the delta
time.


Last Notes
-----------
I wrote this document in a couple hours time so chances are, there's quite a few mistakes or 
things mistakenly left out. If there's anything wrong, let me know.
